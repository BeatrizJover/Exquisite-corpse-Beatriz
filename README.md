# The Forgotten City :european_castle:

Travel into the past to relive the mysteries of an old city <br>
You never know what treasures await you there <br>
Hope its not a Pandora's box! <br>
:mount_fuji:

In the Forgotten City, time seems to have stopped. <br>
Everything is done just like it was hundreds of years ago. <br>
Do you want to know how all was back then? <br>
Then, waste no second and go right away! <br>

Beware of the dangers, but if you succeed, great rewards you will find. :stars:

Or a Ring of Power <br>
or cursed Aztec treasure<br>
But perhaps you'll find a Shell of Power. That wouldn't be too bad.<br>:trophy:

Maybe you'll even stumble upon an ancient vending machine that only dispenses wisdom—unless it’s out of stock. <br> 
Just don’t press the “self-destruct” button; they were really into dramatic exits back then. <br> 
And if you find a time-traveling chicken, well, don’t ask… just follow it.
